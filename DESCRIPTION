Description: The American Community Survey (ACS)
    <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs> offers geodatabases with
    geographic information and associated data of interest to researchers
    in the area. The goal of this package is to generate 'geomultistar'
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geomultistar> objects from those
    geodatabases automatically, once the focus of attention is selected.
    Multidimensional queries with geographic information can be easily
    defined on these objects.
