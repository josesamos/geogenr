Description: The American Community Survey (ACS) offers geodatabases 
    with geographic information and associated data of interest to 
    researchers in the area. The goal of this package is to generate 
    geomultistar objects from those geodatabases automatically, once 
    the focus of attention is selected. Multidimensional queries with 
    geographic information can be easily defined on these objects.
